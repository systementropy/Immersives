					There are more than 200 types of coronaviruses. Some are more familiar to you than you may realise. Many countries use their own criteria to count the number of Covid-19 cases, but more than 3 million people have been officially confirmed to have been infected, with more than 150,000 fatalities.

					For want of a vaccine, the HIV epidemic raged for 25 years taking over 35 million, mostly young, lives. In its early years HIV created fear, panic and extremely irrational behaviour, such as excommunicating an infected person from the village, to denying healthcare services. Cuba, one of the earliest countries to diagnose a HIV case, took the public health principle of social isolation to the extreme – quarantining anyone infected with HIV into sanatoriums for two months where they were provided food and intensive preventive education, followed by life imprisonment if caught indulging in risky behaviour upon release.

					Six months before the armistice was signed between warring sides to bring down the curtains on World War I in 1918, an ‘unusually fatal’ respiratory disease caught the attention of physicians at a British training camp in Eaples in France. Nearly half of those showing influenza like clinical symptoms were succumbing to the infections. So the Spanish Flu started in France? Some Research seems to suggest that.

					Spain remained neutral through the entire conflict. When the war ended, Portuguese soldiers who were exposed to the virus in France infected others as they passed through the Basque territory on their way home. The health outbreak got widespread coverage in the Spanish media when the King Alfonso XIII got the illness. The disease thus acquired a name: the Spanish Flu.

					“In scenarios resembling the 1918 pandemic as it unfolded in India, locations close to an entry point will have extremely short windows of time to deal with a virulent pathogen, placing emphasis on the emergency management of a short and severe wave of illness. While locations that are distant from the entry point will have longer windows of time to prepare for and deal with less lethal variants of the disease, their task will be prolonged by the more gradual build-up and subsidence of the epidemic wave” (The Evolution Of Pandemic Influenza: Evidence From India 1918-19 by Siddharth Chandra and Eva Kassens-Noor)

					Like 1919 Spanish Flu, most of the cases in the first wave of Covid-19 are being reported from major ports of entry.

				<h3 class="firstSign nonCap">Story from US</h3>
				<div class="text text2">
					<p>
						The Spanish Flu swept through vast swathes of the United States in three waves between 1918-19 claiming more than 650 thousand victims.
					</p>
					<p>
						Major cities and towns in the US sought to implement short term social behavioural changes to restrict the spread of the disease. Schools and religious places were closed. Some cities restricted mass gathering while others mandated wearing of mask in public places.

				<div class="text text2"><p>A recent study shows San Francisco, St Louis, Milwaukee and Kansas City which introduced these measures early reduced transmission rates by up to 30% to 50% and saved millions of lives.</p><p>New York City which is worst hit by the current Covid-19 crisis was quick to adopt preventive measures in 1919. The state rigidly enforced social distancing and enforced staggered business hours.</p></div>

					<p>
						In absence of pharma intervention, short term behavioural changes are key to restrict the spread of a global pandemic. Those who were quick to adapt and adopt could successfully navigate the crisis in 1919. While others had to pay a heavy price for inaction and ineptitude.
